Visual-CTA-Chicago
==================

To allow CTA users to better get around Chicagoland by first taking a virtual trip on the CTA.  People new to the city or visiting, those of us with a few more years on us and very importantly those who are covered by various ADA designations could benefit by something similar to a CTA Tracker but which incorporates video to give us a preview when we will be traveling on the CTA.  Plan as of 12/182013 is to begin with a proof of concept using the Brown Line.
